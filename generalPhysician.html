            <h1>Who is a general physician?</h1>
            <p>General physicians are medical doctors who provide a broad range of non-surgical medical expertise and
                health
                care to patients. Most general physicians treat hospitalised patients, while others treat patients
                through
                their private consultations.</p>

            <h2>Who is an internal medicine physician?</h2>
            <p>An Internal medicine physician is a medical doctor who is highly proficient in internal medicine. These
                physicians mainly focus on diagnosing, preventing, and treating diseases or injuries. They are
                specifically
                trained in detecting and treating common illnesses, chronic and acute illnesses, and other complicated
                diagnostic problems. Internal medicine physicians treat adults with generic medications, although they
                undergo frequent training in subspecialties such as infectious diseases.</p>

                <li><strong>Complicated care: </strong>General physicians are trained to treat patients with complex
                    illnesses where the diagnosis can be difficult. A general physician’s broad training offers

                    limitations of most diagnostic tests. They use these diagnostic tests safely, logically and

                    proper management to lower the risk of the operation.</li>

            <h2>What all tests can a general physician prescribe?</h2>
            <p>General physicians may plan for several assessments that are suitable as per the medical condition. They
                perform several tests, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MRIs, CT scan</li>
                <li>Blood glucose levels</li>
                <li>Electrocardiogram i.e. ECG</li>
                <li>Viral markers test</li>
                <li>Urine analysis</li>
                <li>Complete blood count</li>
                <li>Faecal occult blood test</li>
                <li>Renal function test</li>
                <li>Lipid and pthyroid profile</strong></li>
                <li>Liver function test</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Laboratory assessments such as blood tests are also included, which are specific to the health condition
                that
                a patient may be experiencing. A small piece of tissue or biopsy may be required for diagnosis
                occasionally,
                which is later submitted to a pathologist for a complete assessment. X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans, and
                MRI
                are a part of the inspection procedure, and these imaging tests are performed by radiologists. Hence, a
                general physician may recommend a patient to a specialist for further testing if the condition becomes
                complicated and cannot be treated with medications.</p>
