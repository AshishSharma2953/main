            <h2>Neurosurgery</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Neurosurgery is the branch of medicine that deals with surgery of the nervous system. The nervous system
                is made up of the central nervous nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The brain and the
                spinal cord comprise the central nervous system while the peripheral nervous system is composed of the
                nerves and sensory receptors of the sense organs (such as the ears, eyes, skin etc.). Surgeons who
                perform neurosurgery are called neurosurgeons.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

                techniques are backed with an experienced and qualified support staff team, which makes us one of the
                best neurosurgery hospitals in India.</p>
            <p>Our team are experts at performing brain surgeries and helping you in the recovery process. Here are all
                the details you need to know about the procedure.</p>
            <p>A brain surgery is required to repair structural problems in your brain. They can either be due to birth
                defects, diseases, injuries, or any other problems. Some of the conditions that require neurosurgery
                are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aneurysms</li>
                <li>Epilepsy</li>
                <li>Blood clots</li>
                <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
                <li>Stroke</li>
                <li>Brain tumours</li>
                <li>Nerve damage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our doctors will guide you through the entire procedure of brain surgery. You need to inform the doctor
                about any present medications that you’re taking. Your doctor will advise you on which medicines you
                should stop taking before the procedure. You’ll also have to inform the doctor about any surgeries,
                allergies, or if you’re taking alcohol. Before the surgery, your hair will be washed with a special soap
                to kill any germs or bacteria in the region.</p>
            <p>There are several forms of brain surgeries such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Craniotomy - </strong>
                    This type of surgery is done to remove brain tumours, an aneurysm, drain out blood or infection from
                    an infection, or remove any abnormal brain tissue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biopsy -</strong>
                    This is done to remove some brain tissues or tumours for inspecting them under a microscope.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minimally invasive endonasal endoscopic surgery - </strong>
                    This helps in removing any tumours or lesions from your nose and sinuses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minimally invasive neuroendoscopy -</strong>
                    In this type of surgery, endoscopes are used to remove brain tumours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deep brain stimulation -</strong>
                    In this type of surgery, an electrode is placed inside your brain for transmitting electrical
                    signals
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Immediately after a brain surgery is done, doctors will be monitoring you to see if everything is working
                fine or not. You will generally be seated in a raised posture to avoid swelling of your face.</p>
            <p>The period of your stay in the hospital can last up to a week. However, how long you have to stay depends
                on the type of procedure. You may have to take medications for some time after the surgery.</p>

            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>A patient usually comes to a neurosurgeon after diagnosis by a neurologist. Most of the diagnostic tests
                would have been carried out by the neurologist, but a neurosurgeon may prescribe tests to study the
                problem more closely and confirm the need for neurosurgery. More detailed tests may be performed to
                analyse the problem more closely.</p>
            <p>The most commonly prescribed tests for neurological problems are-</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Imaging</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Modern imaging techniques are able to obtain and study images of the tissues within the body closely. The
                imaging techniques used in Bharat  Healthcare, the best neurosurgery hospital in India, are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computed Tomography (CT): CT scans give two-dimensional images of the tissues within the body. The
                    CT scan uses a contrast dye that is injected into the bloodstream of the patient to give better
                    images. CT scans involve radiation and are not suitable for pregnant women as they may be harmful to
                    the fetus. When a patient is not a suitable candidate for an MRI, a CT scan is the prefered option.
                </li>
                <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI as the name indicates, uses a strong magnetic field and radio
                    waves to obtain images of the internal structures of the body. In addition to images, MRI can also
                    give valuable information about the blood flow and mineral deposits in the body. Since magnetic
                    fields have an effect on the water molecules, MRIs can be used to analyse the water content of
                    tissues. Sometimes, a contrast dye may be used to improve images. The strong magnetic field used
                    makes this scan most unsuitable for a person who has implanted devices or infusion devices in their
                    body. It is very important that anything metallic on the person’s body is removed prior to entering
                    the MRI room.</li>
                <li>Functional MRI (fMRI): Since an MRI is an excellent tool to study the flow of blood it can be used
                    to study the blood flow to areas of the brain. fMRI scans use these properties of the blood to study
                    which areas of the brain are activated by stimulus and for how long. This is extremely useful for a
                    neurosurgeon to study and localise the areas of the brain that govern different functions prior to
                    surgery.</li>
                <li>Positron Emission Tomography (PET): PET scans are used by neurosurgeons when they need more detailed
                    images than those that are obtained by CT and MRI scans. PET scans can produce two and three
                    dimensional images of the patient. The PET scans use radioactive isotopes called tracers that are
                    injected into the patient’s bloodstream to give very detailed and clear images of the brain and the
                    rest of the nervous system. When more than one function of the brain has to be studied
                    simultaneously, different tracers can be used for each function.</li>
                <li>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT): This scan is a nuclear imaging scan that also
                    uses tracers similar to the PET scans. It is used as an additional scan to the other more commonly
                    used scans. A Dopamine Transporter Imaging With Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography
                    (DaT-SPECT) scan is a variation of the SPECT scan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Blood And Urine Tests</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Neurologists and neurosurgeons use urine and blood tests to look for the presence of toxins and protein
                disorders.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The nervous system can be studied through the electrical patterns that are generated in it. An EEG is a
                test that involves the placement of electrodes on the scalp that study and give readings of the
                electrical patterns generated. EEGs are also the tests that confirm brain death.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Electromyogram (EMG)</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, neurological symptoms involve the junction between the nerves and the muscles that they
                control. In an EMG test, electrodes are placed to detect the transmission of electrical signals and the
                level of communication between the nerve and the muscle it controls.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Evoked Potentials</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Evoked potentials are tests that neurologists and neurosurgeons use to study the brain’s response to
                stimuli. The equipment that is used is very similar to that used in an EEG.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spinal Tap or Lumbar Puncture</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Cerebrospinal fluid is extracted through a lumbar puncture or a spinal tap to be studied in the
                laboratory.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nerve or Muscle Biopsy</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Biopsy involves the surgical extraction of a sample of nerve or muscle tissue for neuromuscular
                disorders. Brain tissue especially of tumors are biopsied to study them; a biopsy of nerve or muscle
                tissue is performed in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Muscle samples are usually removed
                surgically or through a thin hollow needle. Nerve samples are removed through an incision. Sometimes
                skin biopsies are required to test for metabolic disorders or for the measurement of the small nerve
                fibres present in the sample. Certain infections or tumours in the brain are tested through a biopsy
                where the sample is retrieved through a surgical procedure.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ultrasound Imaging / Ultrasonography</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Ultrasounds are especially useful when a neurosurgeon needs to measure the properties of blood flow to
                the brain. It is also the most commonly used test to study the nervous system of a fetus or a newborn
                baby. The study of the blood vessels in the neck region is done through carotid doppler scans while the
                study of the vessels in the brain are through the transcranial doppler ultrasound studies. Such scans
                are usually done in patients who have suffered or are at risk of a stroke.</p>

            <h3>Treatment & Preventions</h3>
            <p>Most neurological problems are not preventable. The basic guidelines to keeping oneself in good health
                apply to the health of the nervous system as well. Managing all chronic conditions such as diabetes and
                high blood pressure under medical supervision is important to prevent neurological problems.</p>
            <p>Neurosurgery may be a treatment for some neurological conditions such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cerebrovascular problems such as aneurysms and blood clots</li>
                <li>Stroke</li>
                <li>Tumours</li>
                <li>Injuries</li>
                <li>Nerve damage</li>
                <li>Epilepsy</li>
                <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other general classification of neurosurgeries is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Base Of Skull Surgery: Specialised surgery performed at the base of the skull region.</li>
                <li>Spinal Surgery: Surgery of the spine in order to treat injuries or other neurological issues.</li>
                <li>Peripheral Nerve Surgery: surgery to treat neurological disorders that are present in the nerves
                    outside of the brain and spine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neurosurgery FAQ &#8217;s</h3>
            <h3>How long does recovery from neurosurgery take?</h3>
            <p>Since the brain does not feel pain due to surgery, the recovery period may not be painful. However, you
                will have to give yourself time to recover as advised by the neurosurgeon. Some patients recover
                relatively quickly while others need rehabilitation and therapy to make a recovery. It depends on the
                type of neurosurgery that is being performed and the severity of the problem.</p>
            <h3>Why do I need to see a cardiologist and/or other specialists before neurosurgery?</h3>
            <p>Your neurosurgeon may want to get an opinion on other underlying health issues to assess the patients
                risk during anaesthesia and other procedures.</p>
            <h3>What are the different kinds of neurological problems?</h3>
            <p>Neurological problems are problems concerning the nervous system. Different neurological problems

                <li>Stroke</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does a neurosurgeon do?</h3>
            <p>A neurosurgeon offers diagnosis and surgical as well as non-surgical treatment for disorders concerning
                the nervous system. The disorders that neurosurgeons treat include tumours, trauma, infection of the
                spine or brain among others.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>What are the different types of neurosurgery procedures?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>With the help of a neurosurgery procedure, the surgeon treats any disorder who can affect the nervous
                system. Some of the procedures performed include;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microvascular decompression</li>

            <h3>How long does it take to recover from brain surgery?</h3>
            <p>The type of procedure done will determine the recovery period of the person. After brain surgery, the
                patient is generally kept in the hospital for about a week or so to observe how his body reacts to the
                surgery. For quick recovery, it is important to have physical therapy, occupational therapy and
                speech-language therapy sessions to regain overall strength.</p>
