                Diagnostic, Therapeutic, Surgical and Counselling options for Women across all age groups.</p>

            <h3>Obstetrics & Gynaecology</h3>
            <p>Women’s health is a very critical component of any hospital’s offering. Right from puberty to pregnancy,
                childbirth to menopause, women go through a host of health issues which need to be addressed from time
                to time.</p>

            <p>At Our Hospital Obstetricians and Gynaecologists provide the best quality diagnostic, therapeutic,
                surgical and counselling facilities for women. Well-equipped with sophisticated delivery rooms and
                gynaecology conversant operation theatres with advanced and modern equipment to cater to all types of
                birthing procedures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Services and treatment offered include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Painless delivery and management of high-risk pregnancy</li>
                <li>Management of normal and instrumental delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Several obstetric units use combined labour, delivery, recovery and postpartum room so that the support
                person, the mother and the neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay. Some units have
                different labour rooms and delivery suites, where the woman is transferred after the delivery.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Laparoscopic surgeries – Diagnostic & Therapeutic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Laparoscopic surgery allows a surgeon to access the inside of the abdomen without making large incisions
                on the skin. Usually, the cut is no more than half an inch. Therefore, it is also called keyhole
                surgery. A small tube called laparoscope with a light source and camera is inserted through the
                incision, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen or pelvis to a television monitor.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tubectomy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Also known as tubal ligation, tubectomy is a surgical procedure in which the fallopian tubes are clamped
                and blocked or separated and fixed to prevent the eggs from reaching the uterus for implantation. It is
                a commonly performed technique for disinfection and preventing conception.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hysteroscopy – Diagnostic & Therapeutic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During a hysteroscopy procedure, a scope is used to take a look inside the uterus. The doctor can view
                the endometrium lining and the opening of the fallopian tube as well as take samples of tissue.
                Hysteroscopy is minimally invasive and can be done in an office or outpatient setting.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Laparoscopic Abdominal Vaginal Hysterectomy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This surgical procedure is carried out to remove the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries through the
                vagina or birth canal guided by a laparoscope. During the surgery, many incisions are made in the
                abdomen through which metal tubes called trocars are inserted to make a passage for a laparoscope and
                other surgical tools.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Non-descent Vaginal Hysterectomy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a non-descent vaginal hysterectomy, the uterus is removed through the vagina in the non-prolapsed
                uterus.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Transabdominal Hysterectomy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A surgical procedure that removes the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen.</p>

            <p>Other special initiatives include Infertility Clinic, Adolescent / Prepubescent Clinic, Menopause Clinic,
                Vaccination and Contraception Clinics. The department also has specialists who treat other ailments
                related to Urology, Nephrology, Oncology – specifically cervical, breast and ovarian cancer as well as

                advances in the field of infertility and very soon we will have a separate centre for Assisted
                Reproduction. We have experts in performing laparoscopy both diagnostic and operative, Sonologists,
                Neonatologists, Neonatal Surgeons and Geneticists to perform specialized work in the field of foetal

                and caring touch to all health issues related to women.</p>
