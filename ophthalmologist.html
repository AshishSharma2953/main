            <h3>When to see an ophthalmologist?</h3>
            <p>People need to see an ophthalmologist when they witness chronic or severe vision symptoms or signs, such
                as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>bulging eyes</li>
                <li>misaligned eyes</li>
                <li>reduced, distorted, blocked, or double vision</li>
                <li>eyelid abnormalities or problems</li>
                <li>seeing colored circles or halos around lights</li>
                <li>excessive tearing</li>
                <li>floaters in the field of view</li>
                <li>seeing flashes of light</li>
                <li>redness in the eyes</li>
                <li>loss of peripheral vision</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Surgery is needed if the symptoms look like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sudden vision loss or changes</li>
                <li>sudden or severe eye pain</li>
                <li>eye injury</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A person should see an ophthalmologist, if they have conditions that can raise the risk of eye
                conditions, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>high blood pressure</li>
                <li>diabetes</li>
                <li>HIV</li>
                <li>Thyroid</li>
                <li>a family history of eye conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The elderly are also at risk of eye-related injuries. So, if you are over 40, you should visit an
                ophthalmologist to know the baseline of your eye health. Even healthy individuals can experience severe
                eye conditions that are difficult to be detected.</p>

            <h3>Other eye doctors</h3>
            <p>Unlike ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians are not medical doctors. However, they all do work in
                the same office or practice.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Post-Operative Eye Care</h3>
            <p>Though the eye operations carried out usually proceed without complications, follow-up care and treatment
                are an important aspect of our recovery process.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Medical supervision</h3>
            <p>Medical supervision is necessary after an eye operation. The patient must spend the first few hours after
                the operation under medical supervision so that any complications that may arise can be prevented. They
                should also be examined at regular intervals by an eye doctor.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Eye drops</h3>
            <p>Laser eye operations affect the fine corneal nerves of the eyes. As a result, the cornea becomes less
                sensitive to the environment. Applying eye drops will lubricate the eye and offer support to the healing
                process.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Post-Cataract Operation Treatment</h3>
            <p>During the surgical treatment of cataract, the clouded lens is removed and replaced with an artificial
                one without affecting the external half of the lens, the capsular bag. In some cases, natural cell
                growth may cause clouding of the posterior part of the capsular bag leading to a secondary cataract. It
                is painless, harmless and can be removed with a special laser treatment. However, the patient needs to
                follow certain rules of behaviour after the eye operation for faster recovery of the sight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid driving in the first twenty-four hours of the operation.</li>
                <li>Do not involve in excessive physical exertion for the first few days.</li>
                <li>Remember to not rub or press on the eye.</li>
                <li>Do not miss medical follow-up appointments.</li>
                <li>Take the prescribed medicines according to instructions.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the eyes donâ€™t come in contact with soap, water or shampoo during your daily hygiene
                    routine.</li>
                <li>Avoid using any additional eyewear.</li>
                <li>Use an eye shield when you sleep.</li>
            </ul>
