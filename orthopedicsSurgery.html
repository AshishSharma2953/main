            <h5><b>Orthopaedic Treatment</b></h5>
            <p>Orthopaedic surgeons deal with the problems of the musculoskeletal system, which may involve the
                following:</p>
            <p>&#8211; Diagnosis of the injury or disorder</p>
            <p>&#8211; Prescribing treatments with medication, exercise, surgery, casting, etc.</p>
            <p>&#8211; Rehab Centres or physical therapy to restore adequate movement, strength and function</p>
            <p>&#8211; Preventing further injury and slowing the progression of diseases</p>

            <p>Apart from the diseases and conditions of the musculoskeletal system, orthopaedics can also
                specialise in certain other areas like the spine, shoulder, hand, foot, ankle, hip or knee. Specific
                fields that they may choose to focus on include paediatrics, trauma or sports medicine.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
            <p>The first thing that an orthopaedic surgeon will do before performing a physical examination is to
                ask about the history of illness or injury. They will then move forward to diagnostic studies, such as
                x-rays and blood tests. After the diagnosis and informing the patient about the problem, they will come
                up with a treatment plan to help them live an active and functional life. The treatment can either be
                nonsurgical or surgical.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5>Nonsurgical treatment:</h5>
            <p>Certain musculoskeletal conditions can be treated without surgery. Orthopaedic surgeons can prescribe
                a treatment that involves medication, exercise, rehabilitation or alternative therapies. In cases when
                patients don’t respond to nonsurgical treatments, they recommend going for surgery.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5>Surgical treatment:</h5>
            <p>There are several types of surgeries that an orthopaedic surgeon can perform. Some of the common
                procedures include:</p>
            <p>&#8211; Arthroscopy: This procedure uses special cameras and equipment to visualize, detect and treat
                conditions inside a joint.</p>
            <p>&#8211; Joint replacement: Joint replacement can be a partial, total or revision surgical treatment. In
                this surgery, an arthritic or damaged joint is removed and replaced with an artificial joint called
                aprosthesis.</p>
            <p>&#8211; Fusion: It involves fusing bones with bone grafts and internal devices like metal rods to heal
                into a single solid bone.</p>
            <p>&#8211; Osteotomy: Cutting and repositioning the bone to correct bone deformity</p>
            <p>&#8211; Internal fixation: This method involves using metal plates, pins or screws to hold the broken
                pieces of bone in a proper position. </p>

            <h5>When should you see an orthopedic doctor?</h5>
            <p>Muscle and joint pain are often short-term and go away on their own if you had them during an injury. But
                if your pain lasts more than 3-5 days, you may need to consult the&nbsp;<strong>best orthopedic hospital
                    in (Location...) i.e. (Hospital Name...) Hospital (Location..),</strong>&nbsp;if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>you are finding it difficult to move as you used to do before injury</li>
                <li>you are unstable when you walk or stand, or</li>
                <li>you have a hard time doing daily activities, like walking</li>
            </ul>
