            <h3>Common Physiotherapy Treatments</h3>
            <p>Physiotherapy is quite effective to speed up the healing process for patients with amputations, strains
                in
                the spine, arthritis or who underwent any sort of medical operation.</p>
            <h3>Some of the common treatments involved in physiotherapy include:</h3>
            <h3>Electrotherapy</h3>
            <p>It is a type of energy-based physiotherapy technique in which electrical stimulation is delivered with
                the
                help of electrodes attached to the skin. Electrotherapy is performed in patients with paralysis and
                severely
                reduced range of motion.</p>
            <h3>Range of Motion Exercises</h3>
            <p>The body needs adequate rest during the early stages of recovery from surgery or bone injuries, but long
                periods of immobility may actually lengthen the healing process. Therefore, range of motion exercises
                are
                ordered to encourage movement and joint mobility and facilitate circulation. It is also beneficial in
                preventing muscle atrophy and related postural problems.</p>
            <h3>Cryotherapy and Heat Therapy</h3>
            <p>Professional athletes and people with desk jobs often complain of sore and stiff muscles. In such a case,
                application of heat or cold to the affected areas can relieve them of muscle tightness anywhere on their
                body. In heat therapy, hot packs or paraffin wax are applied. Cryotherapy may involve an ice massage or
                application of ice pack.</p>
            <h3>Soft Tissue Mobilisation</h3>
            <p>It is also known as therapeutic massage and can help in relaxing the muscles and reduce the swelling in
                certain areas. Soft tissue mobilisation is an excellent technique to treat the pain associated with
                athletic
                injuries. It also helps in ensuring adequate blood circulation, lymph flow and reducing swelling around
                the
                inflamed joints.</p>
            <h3>Kinesio Taping</h3>
            <p>In this physiotherapy treatment, a Kinesio tape is applied to the skin to stabilise the joints and
                muscles
                while the patient undergoes treatment. Moreover, the Kinesio tape doesn’t obstruct any movement during
                the
                range of motion exercises.</p>
            <h3>Therapeutic Ultrasound</h3>
            <p>It involves the utilisation of sound waves to treat injuries in the body. The sound waves are absorbed by
                ligaments, tendons and fascia and can relieve a person suffering from arthritis, muscle strains and
                tendonitis.</p>

            <h4>Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation FAQ's</h4>
            <h3>Who needs physiotherapy?</h3>
            <p>Modern life is fast-paced and chock a block full of needs, demands, deadlines, and hassles. Everyone is
                running after something in emergency mode. As a result, back pain, knee pain, neck strains, etc. have
                become
                commonplace. People rely on all sorts of over-the-counter medications and painkillers to relieve them.
                However, they don’t think of visiting a physiotherapist until the problem has aggravated.</p>
            <p>Although you do not need a physiotherapist for every sprain and ache, you must pay a visit when you have
                any
                of the following conditions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of balance: You may feel a loss of balance if you have issues in your inner ear. Known as the
                    vestibular system, certain structures inside your ear maintain your body’s balance system. So, any
                    conditions affecting the inner ear can produce symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, and balance
                    disturbance.
                    Physiotherapy can help you to re-train your central nervous system and compensate for the vestibular
                    problems.</li>
                <li>Chronic pain: If you have been in pain for more than a few days, you need to go to a
                    physiotherapist.
                    They can diagnose your problem and suggest a treatment plan.</li>
                <li>Before and after surgery: As surgeries can result in certain complications, getting physiotherapy is
                    essential both pre and post operations.</li>
                <li>Neurological disease: Conditions like Parkinson’s disease, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, and
                    stroke can affect the patient’s movements severely. With physiotherapy treatment, they can’t get rid
                    of
                    the condition, but can surely have a better quality of life.</li>
                <li>Pregnancy: During pregnancy and after it, you have to pay extra attention to your body. The
                    ligaments
                    that support your back can soften due to hormonal changes. The muscles of your pelvic floor and
                    stomach
                    stretch as your baby grows. Without adequate joint support, injury to the pelvis and back can
                    happen.
                    Physiotherapy not only helps you to support your body but also helps you to recover faster.</li>

            <h3>What is physiotherapy treatment?</h3>
            <p>Physiotherapy is a customized physical therapy program that can be beneficial for individuals trying to
                return to their earlier levels of mobility and functionality. It is aimed at inculcating activities and
                lifestyle changes to prevent further injuries and bring overall well-being.</p>
            <p>While the treatment for every individual is tailored to fit their specific conditions, the therapies that
                physiotherapist will choose can be broadly divided into the following.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual therapies: Manual therapies include manipulation and mobilization techniques for the joints
                    and
                    spinal cord, stretching exercises, and manual resistance training.</li>
                <li>Exercise programs: Training programs like cardiovascular stretching, muscle strengthening, and
                    posture
