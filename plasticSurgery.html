                Different types of surgeries that have been performed at Bharat  Health, the <strong>best cosmetic

                so far include:

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Common Plastic Surgery Procedures</h3>
            <h3>Dermabrasion</h3>
            <p>The dermabrasion procedure gently removes the top layer of the skin with the help of a high-speed
                rotating brush. The area gradually heals forming new skin. Dermabrasion is performed to treat acne
                scars, age spots, sun-damaged skin, wrinkles, lesions on the skin, crow’s feet, etc.</p>
            <h3>Liposuction</h3>
            <p>Liposuction is performed to remove fat deposits from the body to improve its shape. The most popular type
                is tumescent liposuction, where a solution containing local anaesthetic and epinephrine drug is injected
                into the target areas of excessive fatty deposits. Instruments called cannulas are then used to suction
                out the liquid along with the fat.</p>
            <p>Ultrasonic-Assisted Liposuction or UAL may also be performed. In this procedure, the cannula releases
                ultrasonic energy to break up fat deposits so that it can be suctioned out of the body.</p>
            <h3>Rhinoplasty</h3>
            <p>Rhinoplasty is performed to reshape the nose for cosmetic reasons as well as for medical reasons to
                correct breathing or birth defects. Some bruising can be seen after the surgery, but that fades away in
                a few days.</p>
            <h3>Rhytidectomy</h3>
            <p>Rhytidectomy or facelift is done to tighten the skin of the face, smoothen deep lines and minimise
                sagging for a youthful appearance.</p>
            <h3>Lip Augmentation</h3>
            <p>Individuals, looking to get fuller-looking lips, go for the lip augmentation procedure. The surgeon uses
                injectable dermal fillers to increase the lip volume, structure or shape. The procedure doesn’t produce
                permanent results. A second procedure might be needed after six months to restore the shape and volume.
            </p>
            <h3>Gynaecomastia Treatment</h3>
            <p>Surgery is performed to remove the excessive amount of male breast tissue. Excessive tissue can be caused
                due to genetics or the use of steroids. If drugs are the cause of gynaecomastia, the patient has to stop
                using the drug prior to the surgery.</p>
            <h3>Preparing for Surgery</h3>
            <p>The type of preparation you need to do depends on the type of surgery you went through and the type of
                anesthesia being administered to you. Plastic surgery may require multiple procedures done in several
                stages.</p>
            <p>The following are considerations for you to discuss with your surgeon before the procedure is initiated:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask the surgeon about the benefits, risks, and outcomes of the procedure.</li>
                <li>Discuss what type of anesthesia will be administered during the procedure and its recovery time.
                </li>
                <li>Inform your physician of any medications you are currently taking or any allergy you may have</li>
                <li>Be sure to discuss any post-operative instructions such as cleanliness and beauty and medications.
                </li>
                <li>Do not wear any form of makeup including any eye contact on the day of surgery.</li>
                <li>Remove any jewelry piece.</li>
                <li>Ask the medical staff of any dentures or other prosthetic devices you may be wearing.</li>
                <li>Be sure to stop drinking and eating for the recommended period prior to surgery.</li>
                <li>Post-surgery follow up is also necessary.</li>
            </ul>
