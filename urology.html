            <h3>Urologic diseases</h3>
            <p>The urinary tract is your body’s drainage system for the excretion of urine. Urine which is a byproduct
                of
                the food and fluid we consume is eliminated by the kidneys during the blood filtration process. The
                process
                is carried out by the urinary tract that includes your kidneys, ureters, and bladder. To urinate
                adequately,
                the urinary tract needs to work together in the correct order. Urologic conditions include prostate
                problems, stones in the part of the urinary tract, bladder control problems, kidney stones, infections
                of
                the urinary tract.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Reasons you should visit (Hospital Name...) Hospital</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Blood in the urine</strong>
            </p>
            <p>If you detect blood in your urine then it’s immediately a cause for alarm. Visit your primary care
                physician
                right away, and they will help with arranging for an appointment with a urologist. If your urine is not
                the
                normal pale yellow but starts looking brown, pink, or tea-colored, there are chances that there’s blood
                in
                the urine. Remember that, blood in the urine may or may not be visible with a naked eye.</p>
            <p>Sometimes blood in the urine may occur due to the temporary issues which are caused by injury and
                vigorous
                exercise, but usually, it’s due to far more serious urologic diseases like-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bladder infection</li>
                <li>Kidney infection</li>
                <li>Kidney stones</li>
                <li>Kidney, bladder, or prostate cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Poor Bladder control</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The inability to control your urine can signal a severe urological issue, and if not treated at the
                earliest
                it can lead to chronic conditions. The severity can include urine leakage when you cough or sneeze, and
                having the strong urge to urinate and not making it to the toilet in time. If this situation continues,
                you
                will have to see a urologist as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Painful urination</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Painful urination for women usually means that they can contract a Urinary Tract Infection, and in men,
                it
                can mean they have a prostate condition. Some other causes can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bladder stones</li>
                <li>Chlamydia</li>
                <li>Cystitis</li>
                <li>Sexually transmitted infections</li>
                <li>Kidney stones</li>
                <li>Prostate inflammation</li>
                <li>Vaginal infection</li>
                <li>Yeast infection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Pain in the lower abdomen, Sides, or Groin</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Painful urination also signifies stone in the kidneys. When you feel intense pain during urinating, it
                may
                come from the stones that move around when urinating. Symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severe pain when standing, lying down or sitting</li>
                <li>Blood in the urine</li>
                <li>Difficulty urinating</li>
                <li>Nausea, vomiting, and fever (which usually happened due to the infection)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Fallen bladder protrusion</strong>
            </p>
            <p>This condition usually affects women and the symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tissue protruding from the vagina</li>
                <li>Pain in the pelvic region</li>
                <li>Difficulty in urinating</li>
                <li>Feeling that your bladder is not empty even after urination</li>
                <li>Urine leakage during sneezing, coughing, exertion</li>
                <li>Bladder infections</li>
                <li>Painful intercourse</li>
                <li>Lower back pain</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Hernia</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The symptoms can be hard to detect, but you may see or feel a bulge that’s created by the hernia. The
                bulge
                will be more evident once you’re standing. Coughing and other strain will make the bulge quite
                noticeable.
                Once the diagnosis is confirmed, you need to get urology treatment without any delay.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Diagnosis: What to expect?</h3>
            <p>Generally, a urologist will start with one or more of the following tests to find out what condition you
                have. Often the diagnostic tests begin with blood and urine tests to gauge the actual cause.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They may perform imaging tests like a CT scan, MRI scan or ultrasound to check inside the urinary
                    tract.
                </li>
                <li>Urologists might order a cystoscopy procedure, which involves advancing a thin scope called
                    cystoscope
                    in your body to see the inside of the urethra and bladder.</li>
                <li>A cystogram procedure can allow urologists to take an X-ray image of the bladder.</li>
                <li>To check how fast urine leaves the body during urination, a post-void residual urine test is
                    conducted.
                    It also shows the amount of urine left in the bladder after the patient urinates.</li>
                <li>Urine sample test can be done to check for infection-causing bacteria in the urine.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Effective diagnosis at a urology hospital</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Initial examination of the patient</strong>
            </p>
            <p>This is the initial stage, and the doctor will collect the medical history and information that comes
                with
                the patient’s condition. They will examine the patient’s physical condition and ensure that the organs
                and
                lymph nodes are in proper condition.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Laboratory examination</strong>
            </p>
            <p>This includes various tests, like blood and urine, to ensure that the kidneys and bladder are in proper
                condition.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Urodynamic testing</strong>
            </p>
            <p>This is a modern form of examination and its purpose is to determine the functions of the urinary system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Endoscope examinations</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The doctor will use a special instrument called an endoscope, which will allow a careful examination of
                the
                internal surface of the genitourinary system.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ultrasound diagnostics</strong>
            </p>
            <p>This is considered as one of the most effective methods of testing for urologic diseases. The main
                benefits
                include the absence of contrasting agents and there is no need to depend on the results of functional
                kidneys.</p>
            <h3>Treating Urinary problems</h3>
            <p>Urinary problems will usually occur when the urinary tract is infected by pathogens like fungi, viruses,
                and
                bacteria. Usually, generic urology diseases can be treated by antibiotics because they are caused due to
                infections. You must complete the course of your medication to ensure a faster recovery. It’s important
                to
                keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids because it will help you feel better. If the
                symptoms
                don’t go away with medication, then there may be an underlying problem and your urologist may recommend
                intense forms of treatments.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Surgical Procedures in Urology</h3>
            <p>Urologists are trained to perform different types of surgery, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>biopsies of the bladder, kidneys, or prostate</li>
                <li>a cystectomy to remove the bladder for cancer treatment</li>
                <li>a kidney transplant to replace a damaged kidney with a healthy one</li>
                <li>extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy that breaks up kidney stones so that they can be removed
                    easily
                </li>
                <li>a procedure to open a blockage</li>
                <li>a repair of damage due to injury</li>
                <li>prostatectomy to remove all or part of the prostate gland for the treatment of prostate cancer</li>
                <li>repair or reconstruction of urinary organs that aren’t well-formed</li>
                <li>a sling procedure for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Here, strips of mesh are used to
                    support
                    the urethra and keep it closed.</li>
                <li>ureteroscopy for the removal of stones from the ureter and kidneys</li>
                <li>vasectomy, a procedure followed to prevent pregnancy. It involves cutting and tying the vas deferens
                    or
                    the tube sperm travel through to produce semen</li>
                <li>transurethral resection of the prostate for the removal of excess tissue from an enlarged prostate
                </li>
                <li>transurethral needle ablation of the prostate that removes excess tissue from an enlarged prostate
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What does a urologist do on your first visit?</h3>
            <p>Your primary doctor will first consult you to a urologist. The urologist will then study your case and
                run
                some tests to find out your medical condition. After diagnosis, the urologist will suggest the treatment
                that would be appropriate to your condition. It is important to be well-prepared with your medical
                history,
                previous test results, and any changes you observed in your health.</p>
            <h3>What diseases do urologists treat?</h3>
            <p>Urologists treat all diseases and conditions concerning the urinary tract. The diseases include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): This is a disease where the prostate gland increases in size.
                    BPH is
                    not directly connected to the prostate gland and is mostly observed in older men.</li>
                <li>Urinary Incontinence: This refers to a loss of bladder control</li>
                <li>Urinary Tract Infections (UTI’s): Pathogenic bacteria or viruses enter the urinary tract and cause
                    infection.</li>
                <li>Kidney Stones: Deposits are formed in the kidneys and cause mild to excruciating pain when passed
                    through urine.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do you know if something is wrong with your kidneys?</h3>
            <p>Kidneys are a pair of organs that filter your blood and help remove toxins from your body. When kidneys
                lose
                the ability to filter waste from your blood a kidney failure may occur. Some of the symptoms to look out
                for
                are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seizures</li>
                <li>Excessive fatigue</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Swelling of your legs, feet, and ankles</li>
                <li>Reduced urine flow</li>
            </ul>
